Rules regarding use of the repository [DRAFT]
=============================================

* Access will be removed well before the start of the contest. At this point (once the template is finalised) we'll be pushing our maven skeleton to all repositories. This gives everyone an equal start.
  * There's no requirement to use our template but we think it'll be helpful for those who are unfamiliar with Maven. We'll be providing tutorials and other resources in due course.
* Access will be restored to the repositories in time for the contest. This allows peope to actually work on their plugin but ensures they don't write code beforehand.
* Developers should push to their repository regularly during the contest time (if you're committing and pushing less than twice per hour while working then you're doing it wrong).
* Developers must use the provided repository. Developers may not accept pull requests during the contest time.
* At the end of the contest, access to the repositories will be revoked until judging is complete. Once we've judged the work, access will be restored - you're welcome to continue working on the project either in our repository or by making your own.
* Binaries should not be pushed to the repository.
* You may use the wiki functionaliy or make use of markdown files to document your plugin.
